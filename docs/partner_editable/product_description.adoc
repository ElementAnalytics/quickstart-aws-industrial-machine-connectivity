The primary objective of the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start is to help AWS Partners deliver a proof of concept that addresses a use case of high value to the customer. For example, the customer might want to start by visualizing near-real-time operational metrics and analyzing root causes when a line goes down. After a successful proof of concept, the partner and customer may work together to build out the production architecture to address other critical use cases. 

With this Quick Start, you can automate production rollout of a connected-factory architecture across multiple sites. You can apply artificial intelligence and machine learning either in the cloud or at the edge. You can organize, store, and manage your IIoT data in various ways:

* Create or transfer virtual assets. 
* Create or transfer asset hierarchies. 
* Create a time-series hot-data store. 
* Transfer data from a historian or a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system. 
* Archive cold data in Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier (Amazon S3 Glacier). 

The {partner-product-short-name} architecture includes AWS managed IoT edge services and AWS-qualified edge hardware. You can use a wide range of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and protocols. You can convert to HTTPS, MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), or OPC Unified Architecture (UA).

When you launch the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start, an AWS CloudFormation template automates the deployment of resources into your AWS account. <<IMC-QS-overview>> shows a dotted orange box around the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start's main components.

* In the factory: 
** AWS IoT Greengrass ingests data from PLCs, equipment, data stores (SCADA or historian), and other customer assets. 
** AWS IoT Greengrass runs on an industrial PC (an AWS-qualified edge-gateway device) that's also running third-party asset-modeling edge software. Examples of this software include Inductive Automation's https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/[Ignition^] and PTC's https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/kepserverex/[KEPServerEX^].  
* In the AWS Cloud:
** AWS IoT Core receives and routes messages either directly from the third-party edge software or from the AWS IoT Greengrass core.
** AWS IoT SiteWise maintains the asset hierarchy's metadata. It contains a managed database for all the time-series data generated by the customer assets. After asset hierarchies are defined in AWS IoT SiteWise, your IIoT data is continuously extracted, converted, filtered, and sent to the AWS Cloud. All the pertinent metadata is readily accessible to applications that use this information to deliver business value.
** Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores your manufacturing data.
** Amazon QuickSight gives you access to custom business-intelligence dashboards and visualizations for data stored in the S3 bucket so that you can monitor the condition of your assets.

You deploy this Quick Start in either in virtual mode (for evaluation and training) or in physical mode (for customer deployments). The mode you choose depends on whether your edge hardware is virtual or physical. 

* The architecture for virtual edge hardware includes an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. 
* The architecture for physical edge hardware includes an industrial PC on the customer premises. 

The mode determines the way you configure connectivity and security. All other cloud-based resources are largely the same for virtual and physical deployments.
