===== Deployment configurations

The IMC kit can be deployed in 3 configurations - virtual, physical greenfield and physical brownfield.

====== Virtual

The virtual deployment is intended for demonstration, training and evaluation of the Kitâ€™s capabilities. EC2 instances will be launched to simulate edge gateway hardware but in all other respects the experience will mirror that of the real physical deployment. This deployment mode relies on simulated tag values generated by the partner edge software. There are no physical PLCs or sensors that are being connected.

====== Physical

Physical deployment of the IMC kit enables users to deploy edge software (i.e. AWS IoT Greengrass and partner edge software) on physical industrial PCs that are ready to connect to physical devices (I.e. PLCs)/historians/SCADA systems on the customers plant floor. The physical deployment has two flavors:

*Physical - Greenfield*

* AWS IoT Greengrass and the partner edge software will be running on a single industrial PC.

*Physical - Brownfield*

* AWS IoT Greengrass will run standalone on an industrial PC and will connect to partner edge software application that is already running on the customers premises (i.e. on a VM in the server room of a manufacturing plant). We assume our access to the hardware is limited or non-existent, and our ability to reconfigure the Edge Software Application Server is limited to additive changes only.

The type of deployment (Virtual or Physical) determines whether to use physical edge hardware (Physical industrial PCs) or virtual edge hardware (EC2) and how connectivity and security is configured. All other cloud-based resources are largely the same.

===== Data flow options

In addition to the Virtual/Physical edge hardware distinction, the IMC kit supports three types of data flow architectures. Each type outlines different methods of data ingestion from the edge environment into the AWS Cloud. 

====== Option 1 - Edge Software Application OPCUA Server -> AWS IoT SiteWise

In this variant, we have the AWS Greengrass SiteWise Connector configured to connect to the Edge Software Application OPCUA Server. All telemetry data will flow directly into AWS IoT SiteWise.

====== Option 2a - Edge Software Application Server -> AWS IoT Core

In this variant, the Edge Software Application Server has some kind functionality to connect to IoT Core via MQTT. All telemetry data is pushed from the Edge Software Application Server to AWS IoT Core, and from there usually pushed to S3 or a similar data lake for processing.

====== Option 2b - Edge Software Application Server -> AWS Greengrass Core -> IoT Core -> S3

This variant is almost identical to previous one (option 2a), except we instead have the Edge Software Application Server pushing MQTT data messages to AWS Greengrass Core first, and then those messages are forwarded on to AWS IoT Core.
